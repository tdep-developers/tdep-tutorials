Stochastic TDEP (sTDEP) for Zirconium
===

This example shows how to perform statistical sampling for bcc zirconium, and how to obtain a positive definite spectrum at high temperatures.

## Steps

1. Go to the folder `sampling.1300K/iter.000` to start the sampling
2. Check the `Makefile` and the target `init`
3. `make init` to create the first 4 samples
4. compute the forces with `make compute`, this will use the So3krates potential to compute forces for the samples and create TDEP input files
5. now we can extract the forceconstants â†’ `make fc`
6. inspect the phonon dispersion
7. create the next iteration from the current set of force constants, `make iteration`
8. move the folder `iter.001` down and `cd` there
9. repeat until convergence

## Things to look out for

- At each iteration, `canonical_configuration` is used and its output is saved to `canonical_configuration.log`. Inspect how in particular the mean-square displacement changes from iteration to iteration
- Observe how the dispersion converges more and more.
- Think about computing other observables, e.g., free energies, and check its convergence.
- After how many iteration does the dispersion stabilize?
