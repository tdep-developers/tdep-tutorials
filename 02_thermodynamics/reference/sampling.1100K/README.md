Free energy with stochastic TDEP (sTDEP) for Zirconium
===

This example shows how to compute free energy for bcc zirconium using sTDEP.

## Steps

1. Go to the folder `reference/sampling.1100K/iter.005` to start the sampling
2. Copy the `infile.forceconstant` file from your previous calculation to the folder.
3. Check the `Makefile` and the target `init`. You should see the absence of the `-mf` variable since you are already starting with a `infile.forceconstant`.
4. `make init` to create the first 128 samples
5. compute the forces with `make compute`, this will use the So3krates potential to compute forces for the samples and create TDEP input files
6. now we can extract the forceconstants â†’ `make fc`
7. inspect the phonon dispersion
8. create the next iteration from the current set of force constants, `make iteration`
9. move the folder `iter.006` down and `cd` there
10. repeat until convergence

## Things to look out for

- At each iteration, the harmonic free energy and the U0 correction term are computed. Look at their evolution with the number of configurations.
- After how many iteration does the total free energy stabilize ? Is it the same as for the phonon dispersion stabilization ?
